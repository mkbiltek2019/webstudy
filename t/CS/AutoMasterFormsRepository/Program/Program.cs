//This project is provided as an example of how to implement the following three interfaces: IMasterFormsRepository, IMasterFormsCategory, and IMasterForm.
//This demo is not intended to be a running one. These three interfaces are used with Leadtools.Forms.Auto.AutoFormsEngine class to store master forms and categorize them.
//The code provided in this project is the default implementation for the three mentioned interfaces that is shipped with LEADTOOLS SDK for Forms
//This project may help a user to build his own implementation of these interfaces that fits his application, for example, database repository.
